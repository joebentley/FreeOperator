# FreeOperator

FM synthesiser in JUCE using C++. Binaries will be available when the software is at a more advanced stage!

Uniquely the synth has built in randomisation of every FM parameter, and even allows a user to capture a random sequence in order to repeat, which is very useful for techno as shown in the following video:
